This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in a Python function designed to calculate the average of a list of numbers. The function fails silently when provided with a list containing non-numeric values, returning an incorrect result without raising an exception. This can lead to unexpected behavior in applications that rely on the accuracy of the average calculation. The bug is addressed in the solution file by explicitly checking for and handling TypeError exceptions and non-numeric types within the input list.
